NUMBER PLATE DETECTION

Vehicle number plate detection is a crucial component in various applications such as traffic management, toll collection, and security enforcement. This project involves the development of a system that can automatically detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or video streams. Leveraging advanced techniques in computer vision and machine learning, this system aims to accurately and efficiently identify number plates in diverse and challenging conditions, including varying lighting, angles, and occlusions. The implementation of such a system can significantly enhance the automation and accuracy of vehicle monitoring processes, providing a robust solution for modern transportation and law enforcement needs.
